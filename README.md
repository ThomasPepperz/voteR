The three (3) metadata files are not used directly in the analysis, and therefore do not require additional formatting and can be viewed as is

"README FILE_EX-003" ought to be opened in Microsoft Word and read first since it functions as an introudction to the voter registration data sets as well as the other two metadata files (e.g. explains naming conventions)

"Public EX-003-File Layout" (.xlsx) ought to be viewed second since it contains metadata that defines and explains each attribute column (offers additional notes and char.length for each attribute)

"SPLIT_DISTRICTS_04_03_2017_08_57_17" comprises 2,400,26 records describing "split" voting districts and precints along with "split_code," "precint_code," "district_type," "district_name," and "county" and probably can be discarded
